## Response - I have created the  assignment that includes the following functionality:

1. Photo Listing Page: created a web page that displays a list of photos using React as the frontend. The photos are fetched from Node API, which is connected to a MongoDB database.

2. Popup Slideshow: When the user clicks on a photo in the listing, a popup appears displaying the clicked photo along with its. The popup acts as a slideshow, allowing the user to view the photos one by one.
   
3. Pagination: The photo listing is paginated, meaning that the user can navigate through multiple pages to view more photos.

4. Random Images: I have used random images as placeholders for your photo listing. These images are fetched from the MongoDB database.
